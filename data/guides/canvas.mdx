# Canvas

Canvas is an imperative addition to the Grandeur family. It is a prototyping tool that lets you drag and drop widgets — like buttons, sliders, displays, and graphs — to sketch a layout which you can use instead of coding a full app. This means you do not have to have app designers in your team before starting to build IoT — a single hardware engineer is a beast with Grandeur.

## Managing a Widget

To add a new widget, tap on the Add Widget icon and choose the required widget from the dropdown list. 
Once you’ve added a widget you need to configure it. You have to be careful while naming the variable similar to the device side variable so that they can communicate with each other. 
Once configured, you run the widget after choosing the particular device.
