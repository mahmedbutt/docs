# Access Credentials

**Auth Token**

The user scope is wider than the device scope. A user can access its profile, the registry of the devices it's paired to, the files in the project's storage and the data in the project's datastore. When a user logs in, an Auth token is returned. This token along with the API Key, being sent with every request, is what validates the authority of the request.

The device scope is limited to the device's namespace in the device registry. When a user pairs with a device, an access token is returned for the device. This access token along with the API Key is what authenticates the device's connection to Grandeur.

This is how the global project scope is distributed among the smaller entities and we make sure that everyone gets what they are allowed to access.
