# CLI- Command Line Interface


Grandeur CLI a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. 
It works as a universal code compiler and package manager for microcontrollers. Our CLI is ased on Arduino and currently supports ESP8266 and ESP32 family.


###Install
Start with downloading Grandeur. The package is currently hosted on Github. Run following command into your terminal to globally install the cli

```npm install https://github.com/grandeurdev/cli -g```
Get Started
Create a new project with init command. Running this command will create a new sketch folder in current working directory, containing the ino code file and a package.json file. Simplify specifiy the architecture and let Grandeur automatically handle the board dependencies.

```grandeur init```
Init command

###Manage Dependencies
Grandeur provides npm like interface and make it super easy for hardware developers to manage dependencies. To install a library from Arduino library manager, simply run this command

```grandeur install <library-name>```
Running this command wil automatically update the package.json file. That means, you can always restore your enviroment in another computer by running install command

```grandeur install```

###Run
To compile and upload the code to hardware, just execute run command in workspace folder.

```grandeur run```
After compilation, the cli will automatically attach the board to display serial logs. Here is a demo for simple hello world code running on ESP32

```
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {

	Serial.println("Hello 👋");
	delay(2000);
}
```
        
Running

###Monitor

Attach to a running device with monitor command.

```grandeur monitor```
